# Question 1: Misuse of OTP

## The OTP

The one time pad is a simple symmetric encryption method that relies on the bitwise XOR function.

If I wanted to encode the following plaintext:

01010101010

with the following pad:

1011101101

I would get the result:

1110111000

BUT, the OTP is not secure when used twice!!

## The Problem

In this folder, there are two image: q1_1.png and q1_2.png. They have been encoded with the same OTP.

Find the key hidden
